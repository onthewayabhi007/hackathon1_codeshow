# hackathon1_codeshow

In this project we have made four pages majorly:

1)Home Page
2)Login/Signup Page
3)Blog Page
4)Profile Page

On the "Home Page" there is the events section for the upcoming events and the ongoing events,Testimonial section to show the testimonial of the students, contact Us section to contact the admin.

On the login page there is two inbuilt function where the user may login as well as signup too.

To access the profile page, you need to click either on the "signup" button or the "login" button (since we were asked to do the frontend part only so we did not write the backend code for the login page)

On the profile page there is a "Blog" section in the navigation bar where the user can see the blogs of the multiple person he/she follows.
